# Welcome to Your Personal Lab Page

This is your personal Hugo site as part of the lab website. Below is a guide to help you get started and customize the template to fit your needs.

## 1. Edit the Title and Description

- Open this file (`content/_index.md`) and modify the `title` and `description` front matter to reflect your personal information.

Example:

```yaml
---
title: "John Doe's Research"
description: "Researcher in Machine Learning and AI at the Laboratory."
---
```

## 2. Add Your Biography

- Update the `content/about.md` file to add a brief bio about yourself. This is a great place to introduce who you are, your background, and your role in the lab.

Example:

```yaml
---
title: "About Me"
---
I am John Doe, a researcher specializing in AI and machine learning at XYZ Lab. My work focuses on developing intelligent systems for cybersecurity applications.
```

## 3. Create Your Posts and Projects

- Add new posts by creating Markdown files in the `content/posts/` directory. For example:

```bash
hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
```
````

## 4. Organize Your Research and Work

- In the provided sections like "Projects" and "Posts," you can organize your ongoing research, past publications, or any other significant achievements. These sections are already linked from the homepage, but you can customize them further by editing the layouts in `layouts/` or updating the `config.toml` file.

## 5. Deploy Your Site

- When you're ready to publish your site, GitHub Actions is set up to automatically build and deploy your Hugo site to GitHub Pages. Just push your changes to the `main` branch, and your updates will appear online!

## Customizing Your Site

Feel free to modify the following files and settings to further customize your site:

- **Site Configuration:** Located in `config.toml`, where you can change global settings like theme, language, and menu options.
- **Themes and Layouts:** Modify the design and structure of your site by editing the theme or adding custom layouts in the `layouts/` directory.
- **Static Files:** Place images, PDFs, and other static content in the `static/` directory. You can reference these in your pages like this:

```markdown
